### Hi there ðŸ‘‹



I am Umang Dobhal, a B.Tech CSE student from Delhi.
Soon-to-be Computer Science graduate, I am eager to continue exploring the inspirng, innovative field of Game Development, under the category of Game Programming. To pursue my dream job, I am learning Unity Engine and C# by recreating classic arcade style games like Pacman and many more simple 2D games.
In my graduate studies, Iâ€™ve taken on various leadership roles, including opening a Gaming Community in the campus and coordinating institute-wide event.
Aside from coding and learning new stuff, I like to focus on extra skills like video editing on Da Vinci Resolve.
